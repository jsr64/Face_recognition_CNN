# Face_recognition_CNN

Earlier i tried face recognition using haar cascade....it just used a haar classifier to find faces in an image..

In this project i would attempt face recognition with convoluted neural nets .

### Steps i went through:
    First go through [this]:https://cv-tricks.com/object-detection/faster-r-cnn-yolo-ssd/
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eIBisqx9_g
    
    to detect an object we use some technique to find objects inside an image like:
      1).Sliding window --> we slide a window over an image and use cnn to find object in the window
      2).RCNN
      3).SSD
      4).YOLO
### i would be using YOLO just because it sounds good and i have no hands on experience with No 2,3,4
#### sould not make any difference since i would need to start from scratch

--------------------
sooooo i watched some videos about these algorithms found a good repo named 'darkflow' cloning it and would be implementing it.
