# Face_recognition_CNN

Earlier i tried face recognition using haar cascade....it just used a haar classifier to find faces in an image..

In this project i would attempt face recognition with convoluted neural nets .

### Steps i went through:
    First go through [this]:https://cv-tricks.com/object-detection/faster-r-cnn-yolo-ssd/
    
    to detect an object we use some technique to find objects inside an image like:
      1).Sliding window --> we slide a window over an image and use cnn to find object in the window
      2).
